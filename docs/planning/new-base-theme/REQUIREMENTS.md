## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New block types | Focus on existing 18 blocks; showcases capability without scope creep |
| Animation/motion design | Explicitly excluded per PROJECT.md constraints |
| Multiple theme variants | One polished theme for v1; variants are v2+ |
| Admin UI changes | Frontend theme only; admin shell is separate |
| Component libraries (DaisyUI, etc.) | Fight bespoke design system goal per research |
| Heavy parallax/scroll effects | Performance risk, conflicts with no-animation constraint |
