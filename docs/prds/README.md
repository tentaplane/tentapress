# PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)

PRDs live in this folder.

Write a PRD when you introduce or materially change user-facing behaviour. Keep them practical and short - enough detail that someone else could build it.

### Naming
Use a date prefix and a short slug:

- `2026-01-03-agency-console-dashboard.md`

### Template
Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to start a new PRD.
